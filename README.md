# Love-Calculator

In childhood, we played lots of games with our friends, and the Love Calculator was one of them. In this game, we calculated the percentage of love between two people.

I have created two Love Calculator programs using two different logics.

# First Logic
1. In the first program or LOgic, we check for similar characters between two names and store the count of each matching character in an array or ArrayList.
2. After checking all characters and obtaining their counts, we perform the addition of these counts until it becomes a two-digit number.
3. In this process, we add the first and last elements of the array or ArrayList.
4. like i=0 and n=5 size of array
   arr[i]+arr[n-1-i] (in loop)

# Second Logic
1. In second program we use diffrent logic to calculate percentage.
2. Here, we store the count of each and every character that is similar to those in the word "LOVES."
3. Initially, we concatenate two names, then count each character that matches those in "LOVES."
4. and store count of characters in array if character is not present then we add 0.
5. For example, in "Ranbir+Alia," only 'l' is similar, so we added 1, and for all other characters, we added 0.

7. then we perform addition operations until it become 2 Digit.
8. Final result will be

The primary goal of these calculators is entertainment. They are designed to be fun and lighthearted, providing users with an amusing result to share with friends or for personal amusement.
